MP-Test User's Manual

    .. note::
    
       The new web-based version of the MP-Test User's Manual is not yet available. Please, continue to use the |MPTESTman| on GitHub for now.

|MPTEST>| is a set of functions for implementing unit testing in |MATLAB>| or
|Octave>|. It was initially developed for |MATPOWER>|, and is used by
|MATPOWER>|, |MIPSname| (|MIPS>|), |MPOM>|, and |MOSTname| (|MOST>|),
among many other packages. It also includes a function
:func:`have_feature` for detecting support for optional functionality.

Installation
============

**Note to** |*MATPOWER*| **users:** *MP-Test is included when you install*
|/MATPOWER/|. *There is generally no need to install it separately. You
can skip directly to step 3 to verify.*

Installation and use of |MPTEST>| requires familiarity with the basic operation
of MATLAB or Octave, including setting up your MATLAB/Octave path.

1.  Clone the repository or download and extract the zip file of the MP-Test
    distribution from the |MPTEST>| `project page
    <https://github.com/MATPOWER/mptest>`_ to the location of your
    choice. The files in the resulting ``mptest`` or ``mptestXXX`` directory,
    where ``XXX`` depends on the version of MP-Test, should not need to be
    modified, so it is recommended that they be kept separate from your
    own code. We will use :samp:`{<MPTEST>}` to denote the path to this
    directory.

2.  Add the following directories to your MATLAB/Octave path:

    - :samp:`{<MPTEST>}/lib`
    - :samp:`{<MPTEST>}/lib/t`

3.  At the |MATLAB|/Octave prompt, type ``test_mptest`` to run the test suite
    and verify that MP-Test is properly installed and functioning. The result
    should resemble the following::

        >> test_mptest
        t_test_fcns.......ok
        t_have_feature....ok
        All tests successful (29 of 29)
        Elapsed time 0.18 seconds.


Usage
=====

Write test functions of the following form, where :func:`t_ok`,
:func:`t_is`, :func:`t_str_match`, and :func:`t_file_match` are used to
test for specific conditions or matches.
::

    function mptest_ex1(quiet)
    if nargin < 1
        quiet = 0;
    end
    t_begin(4, quiet);
    t_ok(pi > 3, 'size of pi');
    if have_feature('octave')
        t_ok(1, 'Octave-only test foo');
        t_ok(1, 'Octave-only test bar');
    else
        t_skip(2, 'foo and bar tests require Octave');
    end
    t_is(2+2, 4, 12, '2+2 still equals 4');
    t_end;

Then run your test function:

.. code-block:: text

    >> mptest_ex1
    1..4
    ok 1 - size of pi
    skipped 2..3 - foo and bar tests require Octave
    ok 4 - 2+2 still equals 4
    All tests successful (2 passed, 2 skipped of 4)
    Elapsed time 0.00 seconds.

If you have several test functions, create a function to run them all as
follows::

    function test_everything_ex1(verbose)
    if nargin < 1
        verbose = 0;
    end
    tests = {};
    tests{end+1} = 'mptest_ex1';
    tests{end+1} = 't_test_fcns';
    
    t_run_tests( tests, verbose );

Run all of your tests at once. The output may look something like:

.. code-block:: text

    >> test_everything_ex1
    mptest_ex1.....ok (2 of 4 skipped)
    t_test_fcns....ok
    All tests successful (7 passed, 2 skipped of 9)
    Elapsed time 0.09 seconds.


Documentation
=============

The primary sources of documentation for MP-Test are this User's Manual, especially the :ref:`sec_mptest_reference` section, and the built-in ``help`` command. As with the built-in functions and toolbox routines in |MATLAB>| and |Octave>|, you can type ``help`` followed by the name of a command or M-file to get help on that particular function.
