MATPOWER Docker Image
=====================

A complete [MATPOWER][1] environment is available in a [Docker][2]
container by using the [matpower/matpower][3] image on [Docker Hub][4].
This image essentially just adds [MATPOWER][5] and the [MATPOWER
Extras][6] to the [matpower/octave][7] image, which is simply the
corresponding official [GNU Octave][8] image ([gnuoctave/octave][9])
with several optimization packages pre-installed.

This image supports both a simple command-line mode and, with an X11
server running on the host, the full Octave GUI.


System Requirements
-------------------

You will need working installations of:
- [Docker][10], and
- an X11 server _(optional, required for use of the GUI)_


Getting Started
---------------

### 1. Get the MATPOWER Docker image
```
docker pull docker.io/matpower/matpower:latest
```

### 2. Start Octave in the container

**_command line only_**
```
docker run -it --rm matpower/matpower:latest octave-cli
```

**_graphical user interface_**  
_(requires X11 server to be running and `DISPLAY` environment variable
to be set properly)_
```
docker run -it --rm --network=host --env="DISPLAY" \
  --volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw" \
  matpower/matpower:latest octave --force-gui
```

This runs [Octave][8] in your newly launched Docker container, with
[MATPOWER][1] and the [MATPOWER Extras][6] already installed in the
Octave path.


### 3. Exectute MATPOWER commands

For example ...
```
mpver
test_matpower
runpf('case9');
mpopt = mpoption('verbose', 2);
runopf('case2383wp', mpopt);
```


Additional Notes
----------------

- To run a different version of [MATPOWER][1] or [Octave][8], replace
  the `latest` tag with the appropriate tag from the table in the Versions
  section below.

- You can also replace `octave-cli` or `octave --force-gui` in the
  `docker run` command with `bash` to start your container at the shell
  prompt. From there you can, for example, start multiple GUI instances of
  [Octave][8] in the same container. Two useful aliases defined in the shell
  are `ot` and `otg` to start command-line and GUI versions of [Octave][8],
  respectively.

- You can also access [Octave][8] and [MATPOWER][1] in your running container
  from the command-line on your host machine via `docker exec` where the
  `<container-name>` can be found via `docker container ls --all`.
  ```
  docker exec -it <container-name> octave-cli
  ```


Versions
--------

Several images are available with different combinations of
[MATPOWER][1] and [GNU Octave][8] versions, with the following tags and
naming conventions. Here _current release_ means the most recent
numbered release (currently 8.1 for [MATPOWER][1], and 10.2.0 for
[Octave][8]) and _latest_ `master` refers to the most recent build from
the `master` branch of the [MATPOWER][5] and [MATPOWER Extras][6]
GitHub repositories.

[^1]: One of the MATPOWER 8.0 tests crashes under Octave 10.x and later
_(fixed for subsequent MATPOWER verisons)_, so `8.0c` is fixed at Octave 9.4.0.
