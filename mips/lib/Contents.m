%   Version 1.3         30-Oct-2018
%
%   The MATPOWER Interior Point Solver (MIPS) is a package of MATLAB/Octave
%   M-files for solving non-linear programming problems (NLPs) using a
%   primal dual interior point method. MIPS is based on code written in C
%   language by Hongye Wang as a graduate student at Cornell University
%   for optimal power flow applications. It was later ported to the
%   MATLAB/Octave language by Ray D. Zimmerman for use in MATPOWER.
