.. note::

   The new web-based version of the MIPS User's Manual is not yet available. Please, continue to use the PDF version of the |MIPSman| for now, along with the new reference documentation below.


Reference
=========

The primary sources of documentation for MIPS, aside from the legacy PDF |MIPSman|, are this :ref:`sec_mips_reference` documentation and the built-in ``help`` command. As with the built-in functions and toolbox routines in |MATLAB>| and |Octave>|, you can type ``help`` followed by the name of a command or M-file to get help on that particular function.
