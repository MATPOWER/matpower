We request that publications derived from the use of the MATPOWER
Interior Point Solver (MIPS) explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing
the following 2007 paper.

  H. Wang, C. E. Murillo-SÃ¡nchez, R. D. Zimmerman, R. J. Thomas, "On
  Computational Issues of Market-Based Optimal Power Flow," Power Systems,
  IEEE Transactions on, vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 1185-1193, Aug. 2007.
  doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901301.

The MATPOWER Interior Point Solver (MIPS) User's Manual should also be
cited explicitly in work that refers to or is derived from its content.
The citation and DOI can be version-specific or general, as appropriate.
For version 1.5.2, use:

  R. D. Zimmerman, H. Wang. MATPOWER Interior Point Solver (MIPS)
  User's Manual, Version 1.5.2. 2025. [Online].
  Available: https://matpower.org/docs/MIPS-manual-1.5.2.pdf
  doi: 10.5281/zenodo.15815754

For a version non-specific citation, use the following citation and DOI,
with <YEAR> replaced by the year of the most recent release:
