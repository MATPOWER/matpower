We request that publications derived from the use of the MATPOWER
Interior Point Solver (MIPS) explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing
the following 2007 paper.

  H. Wang, C. E. Murillo-Sánchez, R. D. Zimmerman, R. J. Thomas, "On
  Computational Issues of Market-Based Optimal Power Flow," Power Systems,
  IEEE Transactions on, vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 1185-1193, Aug. 2007.
  doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901301.

The MATPOWER Interior Point Solver (MIPS) User's Manual should also be
cited explicitly in work that refers to or is derived from its content.
