MIPS - MATPOWER Interior Point Solver
=====================================

The [MATPOWER Interior Point Solver (MIPS)][1] is a package of MATLAB/Octave
M-files for solving non-linear programming problems (NLPs) using a primal
dual interior point method. MIPS is based on [code written in C language][2]
by Hongye Wang as a graduate student at Cornell University for optimal
power flow applications. It was later ported to the MATLAB/Octave language by
Ray D. Zimmerman for use in [MATPOWER][3].

System Requirements
-------------------

*   [MATLAB][4] version 7 (R14) or later, or
*   [GNU Octave][5] version 3.4 or later
*   [MP-Test][6] version 7.1 or later


Installation
------------

**Note to [MATPOWER][3] users:** _MIPS and its prerequiste, MP-Test, are
included when you install [MATPOWER][3]. There is generally no need to
install them separately. You can skip directly to step 3 to verify._

Installation and use of MIPS requires familiarity with the basic operation
of MATLAB or Octave, including setting up your MATLAB/Octave path.

1.  Clone the repository or download and extract the zip file of the MIPS
    distribution from the [MIPS project page][1] to the location of your
    choice. The files in the resulting `mips` or `mipsXXX` directory,
    where `XXX` depends on the version of MIPS, should not need to be
    modified, so it is recommended that they be kept separate from your
    own code. We will use `<MIPS>` to denote the path to this directory.

2.  Add the following directories to your MATLAB or Octave path:
    *   `<MIPS>/lib`
    *   `<MIPS>/lib/t`

3.  At the MATLAB/Octave prompt, type `test_mips` to run the test suite and
    verify that MIPS is properly installed and functioning. The result
    should resemble the following:
```
  >> test_mips
  t_mplinsolve......ok (8 of 180 skipped)
  t_mips............ok
  t_mips_pardiso....ok (60 of 60 skipped)
  t_qps_mips........ok
  All tests successful (304 passed, 68 skipped of 372)
  Elapsed time 0.07 seconds.
```

Documentation
-------------

There are two primary sources of documentation for MIPS. The first is
the [MIPS User's Manual][7], which gives an overview of the capabilities
and structure of MIPS and describes the formulations behind the code. It
can be found in your MIPS distribution at `<MIPS>/docs/MIPS-manual.pdf`
and the latest version is always available at:
<https://github.com/MATPOWER/mips/blob/master/docs/MIPS-manual.pdf>.

And second is the built-in `help` command. As with the built-in
functions and toolbox routines in MATLAB and Octave, you can type `help`
followed by the name of a command or M-file to get help on that particular
function. All of the M-files in MIPS have such documentation and this
should be considered the main reference for the calling options for each
function, namely: `mips`, `mipsver`, and `qps_mips`.

[Citing MIPS][11]
-----------------

We request that publications derived from the use of the MATPOWER
Interior Point Solver (MIPS) explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing
the following 2007 paper.

    Computational Issues of Market-Based Optimal Power Flow," *Power Systems,
    IEEE Transactions on*, vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 1185-1193, Aug. 2007.  
    doi: [10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901301][10]

The [MATPOWER Interior Point Solver (MIPS) User's Manual][7] should also be
cited explicitly in work that refers to or is derived from its content.
The citation and DOI can be version-specific or general, as appropriate.
For version 1.5.2, use:

    doi: [10.5281/zenodo.15815754](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15815754)

For a version non-specific citation, use the following citation and DOI,
with *\<YEAR\>* replaced by the year of the most recent release:
