%
%   MP-Opt-Model is a package of MATLAB/Octave M-files for constructing
%   and solving mathematical programming and optimization problems. It
%   provides an easy-to-use, object-oriented interface for building and
%   solving your model. It also includes a unified interface for calling
%   numerous LP, QP, mixed-integer and nonlinear solvers, with the ability
%   to switch solvers by simply changing an input option.
%
%   It is based on code that was originally developed by Ray D. Zimmerman
%   of Cornell University as part of MATPOWER.
