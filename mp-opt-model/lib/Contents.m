%
%   MP-Opt-Model is a package of MATLAB/Octave M-files for constructing
%   and solving mathematical optimization problems. It provides an
%   easy-to-use, object-oriented interface for building and solving
%   your optimization model. It also includes a unified interface for
%   calling numerous LP, QP, mixed-integer and nonlinear solvers, with
%   the ability to switch solvers by simply changing an input option.
% 
%   It is based on code that was originally developed by Ray D. Zimmerman
%   of Cornell University as part of MATPOWER.
