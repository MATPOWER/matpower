function Va = dcpf(B, Pbus, Va0, ref, pv, pq)
%DCPF  Solves a DC power flow.
%   [VA, SUCCESS] = DCPF(B, PBUS, VA0, REF, PV, PQ) solves for the bus
%   voltage angles at all but the reference bus, given the full system
%   B matrix and the vector of bus real power injections, the initial
%   vector of bus voltage angles (in radians), and column vectors with
%   the lists of bus indices for the swing bus, PV buses, and PQ buses,
%   respectively. Returns a vector of bus voltage angles in radians.
