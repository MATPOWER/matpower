function TorF = isload(gen)
%ISLOAD  Checks for dispatchable loads.
%   TORF = ISLOAD(GEN) returns a column vector of 1's and 0's. The 1's
%   correspond to rows of the GEN matrix which represent dispatchable loads.
%   The current test is Pmin < 0 AND Pmax == 0.
%   This may need to be revised to allow sensible specification
%   of both elastic demand and pumped storage units.
