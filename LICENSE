License with an exception added to clarify our intention to allow
MATPOWER to interface with MATLAB(R) as well as any other MATLAB code

terms. The full text of the GPL can be found in the COPYING file

The MATPOWER case files distributed with MATPOWER are not covered
by the GPL. In most cases, the data has either been included with

While not required by the terms of the license, we do request that
publications derived from the use of MATPOWER explicitly acknowledge
that fact by citing [1].
